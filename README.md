# Token Builder

Project to replace my Photoshop token template, taking in an image and generating a 250px x 250px bordered image for D&D.

## Setup

- Secrets: Make a `.env` file in the root of the project, copied from `.env.example`. Fill in the values accordingly.
- Install: `npm i`
- Compile: `npm run build`
- Start: `npm start` will take arguments from dotenv and generate tokens

## .env

- `TOKEN_IN_DIR`: Exact path to directory where images that are to be converted to tokens exist.
- `TOKEN_OUT_DIR`: Exact path to directory where tokens generated by this project will be exported to.

## Testing

`npm test`

### Babel

The babel dependency is entirely for jest to make use of Typescript. This is not for production facing code.
